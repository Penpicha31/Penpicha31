# Data Quality
# Timeliness
- **Definition: ** Timeliness is the degree to which data is up-to-date and available within an acceptable time frame, timeline, and duration.

The value of data-driven decisions not only depends on the correctness of the information but also on quick and timely answers. The time of occurrence of the associated real-world events is considered as a reference and the measure is assessed on a continuous basis. The value and accuracy of data may decay over time.

For instance, data about the number of traffic incidents from several years ago may not be completely relevant to make decisions on road infrastructure requirements for the immediate future.
